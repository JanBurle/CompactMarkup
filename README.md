# Compact Markup(s)

Three super lightweight minimalistic markup languages (text ➔ html):

- MM (Minimal Markup) — very basic, for short simple texts
- MX (Minimal eXtensible markup) — syntax is different, but complete
- CM (Compact Markup) — for longer texts: pages, articles, etc.

## MM, MX: Minimal Markup, Minimal eXtensible markup

It can be processed on the server side (in PHP) or on the client side (in JavaScript).
